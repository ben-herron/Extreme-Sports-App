# Extreme-Sports-App
General-
I began working on this project last summer during my free time. My goal was to create an application that would cater to all categories
of extreme sport athletes. A very large focus of mine when taking on this endeavour, was to have an efficient application, as well as a
very minimalistic interface that pleases the eye.

Login-
There would be logins handled by a sessions Store using mongodb, storing all information in a database, and from there once a user is
logged in, they will be sent to the main screen. 

Main-
The main page has a bottom navigation panel consisting of three options, trick list, sets, and my profile.

Trick List-
Sofar, the tricklist portion of the project has the most progress on it, with a few preset tricks added within a scroll view. Each trick
has its own checkbox beside it that can be selected when the user has completed this trick. As well, when a trick is selected, the user
is re-routed to a page containing a youtube video of this trick being performed. Another functionality that needs to be added to this page
is the option to store your own video there, and be able to view each of the sets you have created which include this trick. The user will
also be able to add new tricks to this list, by typing out the trick name, or by making it with a combination of other tricks already
present in the list. A search bar will also need to be implemented to complete this page.

Sets-
On this page each user will have the ability to create sets of all of their tricks. So lets say if someone wanted to train a certain type
of trick, on a specific type of feature, they could create sets for that feature, containing all the tricks they are able to do, or wanted
to work on that day. Then the app would randomly select a trick for them to try from within the set upon request. For example, if a
snowboarder wanted to work on their tricks on a 12 foot jump, they could select the amount of degrees they can spin, if they can take off
switch or regular, spin backside or frontside, as well as what grabs they could do. After that they can allow the app to randomly decide
on their trick to try, and continue working on that set through the day. Let alone being able to use the app to train, the user could play
a game with their friends by letting the app select the trick, and deciding on who is awarded points if the tricks are landed. In the
future, this page would also have premade sets depending on the type of feature, as well as the ability to see the most commonly used and
trending sets.

User Profile-
Users would be able to select a profile picture, text containing whatever they wish, and control their privacy and accessibility settings.
